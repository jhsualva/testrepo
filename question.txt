What makes you excited about programming?

I guess I would say that having the opportunity to figure out ways to efficiently solve new problems and really put my thinking/problem-solving skills to the test makes me excited about programming.

What is your favorite animal and why?

My favorite animal is a penguin. I think they look really cute and comfy even standing out on the ice, and I like cold weather and snow.
